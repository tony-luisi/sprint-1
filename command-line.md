Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)? 
MUM: THE COMMAND LINE IS THE BOX YOU LITERALLY TYPE WHAT FILES AND FOLDERS YOU NEED, WANT AND ARE LOOKING FOR ON YOUR COMPUTER

10 TERMINAL COMMANDS
1. MV = RENAMES A FILE
2. OPEN = OPENS A FOLDER OR A FILE 
3.-a = ROUGHLY 'APPLICATION', WHAT PROGRAM YOU WANT TO OPEN A FILE
4. RM = REMOVE
5. MKDIR = MAKE DIRECTORY AKA MAKE A NEW FOLDER
6. LS = LIST (SHOWS YOU WHATS IN THE FOLDER)
7. CD = CHANGE DIRECTORY
8. PWD = PRINT WORKING DIRECTORY (WHAT FOLDER YOU ARE CURRENTLY IN)
9. TOUCH = CREATE A NEW FILE (LIKE A TEXT FILE)
10. -P = PATH (RELATES TO THE LINE OF FOLDERS AND SUBFOLDERS)
